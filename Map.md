`map` is a built-in Python function that applies a specified function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object, which is an iterator. The syntax for `map` is:

```python
map(function, iterable, ...)
```

### How `map` Works

1. **`function`**: The function that you want to apply to each element of the iterable.
2. **`iterable`**: An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose elements you want to process using the function.

The `map` function applies the specified function to each item of the iterable, and the result is an iterator that produces the transformed items on demand.

### Example Usage of `map`

Here's a simple example to illustrate how `map` works:

```python
# Define a function to square a number
def square(x):
    return x * x

# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Apply the 'square' function to each item of 'numbers' using 'map'
squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)

# Convert the map object to a list and print it
print(list(squared_numbers))
```

Output:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In the context of the provided code, `map` is used to convert the string representations of numbers in the input data into integers:

```python
a_list = list(map(int, data[0].split()))
b_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))
```

Here, `map(int, data[0].split())` applies the `int` function to each item resulting from `data[0].split()`, converting the strings to integers. The `list` function then converts the map object into a list.

### Full Code with Explanation
Here is the improved code with comments explaining each step:

```python
from itertools import product
import sys

# Read input from standard input
data = sys.stdin.readlines()

# Split the first line into individual strings and convert them to integers
a_list = list(map(int, data[0].split()))

# Split the second line into individual strings and convert them to integers
b_list = list(map(int, data[1].split()))

# Generate the Cartesian product of a_list and b_list
result = list(product(a_list, b_list))

# Convert the result to a space-separated string of tuples
formatted_result = ' '.join(map(str, result))

# Print the formatted result
print(formatted_result)
```

This code reads two lines of input, splits them into lists of integers, computes their Cartesian product, and prints the result as a formatted string.
