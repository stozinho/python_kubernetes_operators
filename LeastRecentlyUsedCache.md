The `lru_cache` is a decorator provided by the `functools` module in Python. It stands for "Least Recently Used Cache" and is used to cache the results of function calls. This can significantly improve the performance of functions that are called repeatedly with the same arguments, as it avoids the need to recompute the result each time.

### How `lru_cache` Works

When a function decorated with `lru_cache` is called, the decorator checks if the result for the given arguments is already in the cache:
- If it is, the cached result is returned immediately.
- If it isn't, the function is executed, and the result is stored in the cache for future use.

The "least recently used" part means that if the cache reaches its maximum size, the least recently accessed entries are discarded to make room for new entries.

### Usage Example

Here's a practical example of using `lru_cache` with a function to compute the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

# Testing the function
print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
print(fib(20))  # Output: 6765
print(fib.cache_info())  # Output: CacheInfo(hits=18, misses=21, maxsize=32, currsize=21)
```

### Parameters of `lru_cache`

- **`maxsize`**: The maximum number of cached entries. If set to `None`, the cache can grow without bound.
- **`typed`**: If set to `True`, different types of function arguments (e.g., `1` and `1.0`) will be cached separately.

### Example with `typed`

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=32, typed=True)
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(add(1, 2))    # Caches the result of add(1, 2)
print(add(1.0, 2.0)) # Caches the result of add(1.0, 2.0) separately from add(1, 2)
```

### Benefits of Using `lru_cache`
- **Performance Improvement**: Significant speedup for functions with expensive computations that are called multiple times with the same arguments.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply add the decorator to the function, and the caching logic is handled automatically.

### Drawbacks
- **Memory Usage**: Caching results uses additional memory. If the function is called with a wide variety of arguments, the cache can grow large.
- **Staleness**: Cached results can become stale if the underlying data changes. This decorator is best suited for pure functions without side effects.

Using `lru_cache` can be a powerful tool to optimize your Python code, especially for recursive algorithms and other expensive computations.
