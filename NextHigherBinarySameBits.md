Certainly! Let's go through the `next_higher` function step by step to understand how it works. This function takes an integer input and returns the next higher integer that has the same number of 1 bits in its binary representation.

Here's the code again for reference:

```python
def next_higher(value):
    s = f'0{value:b}'
    i = s.rfind('01')
    s = s[:i] + '10' + ''.join(sorted(s[i+2:]))
    return int(s, 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Convert the integer to a binary string**:
   ```python
   s = f'0{value:b}'
   ```
   - `value:b` converts the integer `value` to its binary representation as a string.
   - `f'0{value:b}'` ensures that there is a leading `0` to handle edge cases, such as when all the bits are `1`s. This step ensures that the binary string always has at least one '01' pattern to find.

   Example:
   - For `value = 129`, the binary representation is `'10000001'`. Adding a leading `0` gives `'010000001'`.
   - For `value = 127`, the binary representation is `'1111111'`. Adding a leading `0` gives `'01111111'`.

2. **Find the rightmost occurrence of '01'**:
   ```python
   i = s.rfind('01')
   ```
   - `s.rfind('01')` finds the position of the rightmost '01' in the string `s`. This is the key step in identifying where to make the change to get the next higher integer with the same number of `1` bits.

   Example:
   - For `'010000001'`, the rightmost '01' is at index `6`.
   - For `'01111111'`, the rightmost '01' is at index `0`.

3. **Swap '01' with '10' and sort the remaining bits to the right**:
   ```python
   s = s[:i] + '10' + ''.join(sorted(s[i+2:]))
   ```
   - `s[:i]` is the substring from the start of `s` to the position `i` (exclusive).
   - `'10'` replaces the '01' found at position `i`.
   - `s[i+2:]` is the substring from position `i+2` to the end of the string.
   - `sorted(s[i+2:])` sorts the remaining bits to the right of the new '10' in ascending order. This sorting ensures the next highest number is produced.

   Example:
   - For `'010000001'`, replacing '01' with '10' at index `6` and sorting the rest (`'1'`) gives `'010000010'`.
   - For `'01111111'`, replacing '01' with '10' at index `0` and sorting the rest (`'111111'`) gives `'10111111'`.

4. **Convert the binary string back to an integer**:
   ```python
   return int(s, 2)
   ```
   - `int(s, 2)` converts the binary string `s` back to an integer.

   Example:
   - For `'010000010'`, this converts back to `130`.
   - For `'10111111'`, this converts back to `191`.

### Complete Example Walkthrough:

#### Input: 129

1. Binary string with leading zero: `'010000001'`.
2. Rightmost '01' found at index `6`.
3. Replace '01' with '10' and sort the rest: `'010000010'`.
4. Convert back to integer: `130`.

#### Input: 127

1. Binary string with leading zero: `'01111111'`.
2. Rightmost '01' found at index `0`.
3. Replace '01' with '10' and sort the rest: `'10111111'`.
4. Convert back to integer: `191`.

This process ensures that the next higher number with the same number of `1` bits is found efficiently.
